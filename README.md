## About
In this project I am experimenting with creating my own Web API and accessing it through the android application.
There are several branches on this project for different purposes.
- Android application
- API
- Resources (Images)

## Platform
This project is primarly supported on Windows.

## Getting Started
to clone the repository, run a terminal in your desired directory and execute:
```git clone --recursive https://github.com/LukaLominadze/GameDrive```
Then, simply open the project with your IDE and run gradle scripts.

The project is now ready!
